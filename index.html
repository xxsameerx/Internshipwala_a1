                            INTERNSHIP?</u></h3></center>
                <p>Internship is a time tested way of learning a craft or trade
                    under a Master Craftsman through the ages. Apprenticeship
                    Training Scheme is a scheme where young, technically
                    qualified people undergo training under a Master Trainer to
                    become equipped for jobs in the Modern Scenario. It has the
                    double benefit of earning while learning.</p>

                <p>It is an agreement between a person who wants to learn a
                    skill and an employer who needs a skilled worker. The
                    Interns are taught the latest applications, processes and
                    methodologies in their respective fields of work from some
                    of the most renowned organisations in India. This also acts
                    as a transition phase for a school / college student from
                    classroom to a working background.</p>

                <p>The intern also learns soft skills, work culture, ethics and
                    organisational behaviour while undergoing training. This
                    goes a long way in helping him/ her secure permanent
                    employment in the future. At the end of one year training
                    they are issued a Certificate attesting to their training
                    and proficiency in a particular field. This serves as an
                    experience certificate when they seek employment after their
                    training. Best online internship training program in
                    India</p>
